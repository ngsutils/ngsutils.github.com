    Added a <i>fromgff</i> command to gtfutils to help convert GFF files to GTF. Since GFF is
    such a generic format, it won't work with all GFF files, but it does work with those from
    FlyBase. If you have a GFF file that it isn't working with, let us know!

    Added a <i>barcode_split</i> command to fastqutils to split FASTA/FASTQ files based upon
    3' or 5' sequence tags (barcodes). This function is usually taken care of by the sequencer;
    however, in some custom applications, splitting by barcode tags needs to be done manually.

    Completed the addition of over 200 unit tests to NGSUtils. This means
    that every non-experimental command is now being tested. These tests are
    located in the ngsutils/{bam, bed, fastq, gtf}/t/ directories. As part
    of the effort to add unit testing, the entire NGSUtils codebase is being
    refactored to be more library-like, so that it can be more easily be
    included in other projects.

    Finished migrating Git repository over to GitHub from the internal IU GitHub firewall installation. This means that we are
    now running almost exclusively on GitHub infrastructure.
